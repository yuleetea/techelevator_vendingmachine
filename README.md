# techelevator_vendingmachine

This capstone was done in cooperation with Amy Pfaff, a colleague with me in the TechElevator Bootcamp. 

Some of the menu interactions/routing was pre-written for us by TechElevator so instead we had to write out the functionality the command line service as well as the logic for the vending machine item quantities as well as the transactions. We kep a running state of money as well. 

This project is still ongoing.
